We build and release a corpus named **Probase_Desp**, which contains high-quality descriptions of more than 15,000,000 entities and concepts. These descriptions are extracted from [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/). **Probase_Desp** can be seen as the supplementary material for [**Probase**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/probase/), which provides a high-quality uncertain knowledge graph.

We apply **Probase_Desp** and uncertain knowledge graph on the sentence- and document-level relation extraction tasks and achieve significant improvements. **Probase_Desp** can serve as a valuable external knowledge resource for relation extraction and many other natural language processing tasks.
